How to build ovs-int

Install ovs-int test dependencies
e.g.:

apt-get install python-pytest python-testtools python-nose python-mock python-eventlet python-httplib2 python-webob

Get all of the trees. Here's one way:

git clone git://openvswitch.org/openvswitch
git clone git://pull.nicira.eng.vmware.com/ovs-int
git clone git://pull.nicira.eng.vmware.com/stt

Change directory into openvswitcH:

cd openvswitch

Apply the stt patches to the openvswitch tree. You can use Git or quilt for this:
Use "git quiltimport". This will import each of the stt patches as a Git commit. This is more convenient if you already like working with Git:

git quiltimport --patches ../stt

Use "quilt" to apply each of the patches in turn. This is a good way if you already like working with quilt. It has the downside that "git diff" and "git status" will show huge changes in your openvswitch directory:

QUILT_PATCHES=../stt quilt push -a

Bootstrap, configure, and build Open vSwitch. I tend to do my builds in a subdirectory, so that's what my instructions show, but you don't have to:

./boot.sh
mkdir _build
cd _build
../configure --prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var --enable-Werror
make -j8

Install Open vSwitch. I always install it locally to the build directory, to avoid screwing up my real system and to avoid needing to be root:

make install DESTDIR=$PWD/inst

Bootstrap, configure, and build ovs-int:

cd ../../ovs-int
./boot.sh
mkdir _build
cd _build
../configure --with-ovs=../../openvswitch --with-ovs-build=../../openvswitch/_build
make -j8

Run ovs-int tests. This requires being root (this is a bug). It also requires the OVS tools to be in $PATH and that OVS be able to access its installed data. I wrote a script that does this:

sudo make \
	     PATH=$PATH:$PWD/../../openvswitch/_build/inst/usr/bin:$PWD/../../openvswitch/_build/inst/usr/sbin \
	     OVS_PKGDATADIR=$PWD/../../openvswitch/_build/inst/usr/share/openvswitch \
	     OVS_RUNDIR=$PWD/../../openvswitch/_build/inst/var/run/openvswitch \
	     "${@-check}"
