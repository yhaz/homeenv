(Version 3)
2->3 Redo the PPS measurement with proper irq affinity and NIC RSS settings.NIC


Classifier experiment:
=====================
1. Set up

Machine set ups are:  perf125 -> perf128 -> perf127

Perf125 hosts 3 IP addresses:  9.1.1.2, 11.1.1.2 and 12.1.1.2
perf127 hosts 3 IP addresses:  9.1.1.1, 11.1.1.1 and 12.1.1.1
perf128 run OVS under test.

The open flow rules are set up as the following:

"priority= 400, arp, action=normal"
"priority= 300, ip, ip_dst=11.1.1.1/16, action=drop"
"priority= 200, tcp, ip_dst=9.1.1.1, tcp_src=10, tcp_dst=10, action=drop"
"priority= 100, ip, ip_dst=9.1.1.1/255.255.255.0 , action=normal"

With the intention that 9.1.1.2 -> 9.1.1.1 netperf connections are allowed
Any traffic destined to 11.1/16 or 12.1/16 will be dropped


Traffic pattern: 

Traffic are: 
400 concurrent netperf TCP_CRR sessions (running for 10 seconds)
4000 nmap scans/s to 11.1.1.1/17.  (all should be dropped)
4000 nmap scans/s to 12.1.1.1/17.  (all should be dropped)

Note 1: nmap generate 4 probes per host, 2 http syn probe and 2 https syn probes
	So nmap will scan 1000 hosts per second for each nmap session.

Note 2: All netperf and namp scans run concurrently.
Note 3: datapath exact match is always on for this experiment.
Note 4: Data collected with master branch OVS.

Measurements data collected:
TCP_CRR: total connection reported by netperf  average over multiple runs.
MAX DP flows:  obtained by sampling ovs-dpctl output, may be less than actual max.
Average number of masks:  Most common output of ovs-dpctl output during test.
User cpu time:    Top output of  user space % time.
System cpu time:  100% - User cpu time - Top reported idle time.

Megaflow with all Classifier optimization:

                     TCP_CRR                 avg mask/pkt        usr/sys

w/ exact cache         120K                     1.68            0.1%/20%
